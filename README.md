How do I approach designing software?
There are a lot of steps to reliably approach designing software, as I have not done this professionally, I can't attest to that aspect, but theoretically I would do as follows.:

  Acquire Documentation/Requirements
  
  Prototype Design and Functionality
  
    Review Prototype and Establish New Expectations and Design
    
  Modularize the work and develop a schedule
  
  Test code as work is done
  
    Test Security and Scalability, if necessary
    
  Create/Update Documentation as code is finalized
  
  Test Components Working together (Integration)
  Review Code
  
  Submit for further review and finalization
  
  Incorporate final feedback before release
  
  Release
  
  Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
  


What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

It helped me to understand how to incorporate dependencies and libraries into my projects, how to organize project files, and of course using the OpenGL API to generate graphics. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?

There were steps for understanding what needed to be simulated in a 3D space. First was sourcing a scene, followed by incorporating simple shapes and objects into a 3D space, manipulating them to match the objects in the scene, incorporating a camera to traverse the 3D space, applying textures and lighting, and then modifying the final product based on feedback.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

There was a lot of organization in the code that needed to be done so that the 3D space could be initialized properly, so understanding the order of execution from the code. Better commenting to understand where sections of code start and stop. 

How do I approach developing programs?

I prefer the agile methodology, which can be seen described above in the first question.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I had to understand vectors, rendering in a 3D space, and how objects can be projected into the space using triangularly coordinated vertices. 

How did iteration factor into your development?

Every step of the development process was about incrementally improving and developing the scene. Every iteration of the scene as weeks went on improved with each step taken.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My main objective in computer science is a well paying job, but also learning to create and develop personal projects to help improve my every day life through small Quality of Life changes will be a bonus. I love being inquisitive and understanding how things work, and there is a lot of that to do in the world of Computer Science
